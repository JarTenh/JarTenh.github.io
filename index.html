            <p>My name is Jarkko Tenhola, and I'm a curious human being. I always want to learn new things, and one
                of my favorite subjects is learning to code. This involves learning how to develop clean, effective
                and responsive websites, to analyze data using Python or R, or even to tackle machine learning consepts.
            </p>
            <p>My main sources for learning to code are Open University of Helsinki, Codecademy, Datacamp and Udemy.
                The main focus of this site is to showcase my coding projects, so feel free to check them out. Some of 
                the projects are portfolio-projects from Codecademy and some are my own.
            </p>
            <p>My goal is to be able to use my coding skills in working life. If you're interested in contacting me
                feel free to do so. You'll find my contact info from the footer.
